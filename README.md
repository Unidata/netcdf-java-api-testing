Moved to main [netcdf-java repository wiki](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-java/wiki), as new public api was released in version 5.4.0.

netCDF-java New Public API Testing

Short-term repository related to testing and feedback on the new netCDF-Java public API.
The focus here is on discussions through the use of the [repo Issues](https://github.com/lesserwhirls/netcdf-java-api-testing/issues), and [guidelines/documentation on the repo wiki](https://github.com/lesserwhirls/netcdf-java-api-testing/wiki).
The intention is to archive this repo under the Unidata GitHub organization once the public API is complete, and thus is "short lived".
Much of the wiki content will likely end up in the netCDF-Java documentation in some form.
